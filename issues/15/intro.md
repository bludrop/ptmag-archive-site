What are the challenges of being a Jewish leader in today’s here &amp; now?

In thinking about issues of leadership in the Jewish community, the PT15 Steering Committee brainstormed our “elephants in the room”—issues that are plainly perceived, but that few dare to broach, let alone solve.

The eternal elephant in the room is money. After 15 magazine issues and over 500 volunteer contributors engaged around the world, the in-print publication of PresenTense Magazine is in jeopardy. If you believe, as we do, in this magazine, please allow us to continue through subscribing here.

Leaders must adapt to new realities and new opportunities. To solve the issues presented on these pages, the Jewish community would do well to turn to our vibrant network. Enable our network to be the thought leaders, change agents, and executors of the visions we work so tirelessly on to transform and advance the Jewish community.

Thank you for your enduring support and contributions, whether it be time, money, or resources. We hope you will join us in our exploration of Jewish life in the here &amp; now and support the ventures, causes, and dreams of all of us in the PresenTense network.
